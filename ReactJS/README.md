#ReactJS an Introduction

What is ReactJS?

Is a next generation Javascript library for building user interfaces.

React introduces JSX so we can write reusable HTML components. This JSX is compiled into plain JS to be used by your app as needed 

##Features

- Virtual DOM


##Setting up an Environment

In this document will be using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io). 

We'll talk more about these on the future. For now, lets just understand that we use Webpack to manage our dependencies and build our **bundle.js**. Babel in the other hand, transforms Ecma-Script 6 to Javascript 5.1
     
Before you start you'll need to install **npm** if you don't have it already.
